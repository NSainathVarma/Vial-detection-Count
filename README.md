# Vial Detection System with AI-Powered Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced computer vision system that combines YOLO v11 object detection with Google's Gemini AI to create an intelligent vial detection and analysis platform. The system represents a complete pipeline from dataset creation to deployment-ready web application.

## User Workflow

The user journey begins when they launch the Streamlit application, which immediately initializes the VialDetectionChatbot class. This class loads two AI models simultaneously: the pre-trained YOLO v11 model for vial detection and Google's Gemini AI for natural language processing. Users can either upload an image through the file uploader or start with a text-only conversation. When an image is uploaded, it undergoes preprocessing to convert it to YOLO-compatible format before being passed to the detection model. The YOLO model analyzes the image, identifies vials and other objects with confidence scores above the threshold (default 0.6), and generates annotated bounding boxes. These detection results—including vial counts, confidence scores, and positional data—are then combined with the user's original question and fed to the Gemini AI, which provides a contextual, natural language explanation of the findings. The entire process is displayed in real-time through an interactive chat interface showing both the annotated image with detection overlays and the AI's analytical response, creating a seamless conversation flow between user input, computer vision analysis, and intelligent commentary.

## Implementation Details

### VialDetectionChatbot Class

The main class orchestrates the entire detection and analysis pipeline:

```python
class VialDetectionChatbot:
    def __init__(self, model_path="best.pt"):
        # Dual-model initialization
        self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash")  # NLP
        self.model = YOLO(model_path)  # Computer Vision
```

### Detection Pipeline

**Image Preprocessing**
- Format conversion to YOLO-compatible RGB
- Support for multiple input types (file paths, PIL Images, upload objects)
- Robust error handling for corrupt or unsupported formats

**Intelligent Detection System**
```python
def detect_vials(self, image, confidence_threshold=0.6):
    # Confidence-based filtering
    if confidence >= confidence_threshold:
        # Multi-class object tracking
        # Real-time bounding box annotation
        # Statistical analysis
```

### AI-Powered Analysis

The system combines detection results with contextual understanding:

```python
def process_message(self, user_input, image=None):
    # Fusion of computer vision and NLP
    context = f"Vial Detection Results:\n- Total objects: {total_objects}\n- Vials: {vial_count}"
    # Gemini AI provides natural language explanations
```

## System Limitations

### Image Quality Constraints
- **Resolution Dependency**: The system works best on images with high resolution (recommended minimum 1024x768 pixels)
- **Low-Resolution Performance**: Detection accuracy significantly decreases with blurry, pixelated, or low-quality images
- **Optimal Conditions**: Clear, well-lit images with distinct vial features yield the highest detection rates

### Model-Specific Limitations
- **Training Data Scope**: Model performance is optimized for vial types and orientations present in the original 101-image dataset
- **Background Sensitivity**: Complex or cluttered backgrounds may reduce detection accuracy
- **Scale Variability**: Limited performance on extremely small or disproportionately large vials relative to image size

### Technical Constraints
- **Computational Requirements**: Real-time processing requires adequate GPU resources for optimal performance
- **Confidence Threshold Trade-off**: Higher thresholds (≥0.6) improve precision but may miss valid detections
- **Format Limitations**: While multiple formats are supported, some exotic image formats may require pre-conversion

### Environmental Factors
- **Lighting Conditions**: Performance may vary significantly under different lighting conditions not represented in training data
- **Occlusion Handling**: Partial vial obstructions can impact detection reliability
- **Angle Dependency**: Non-standard viewing angles may reduce detection confidence

## Scalability Considerations

### Modular Design
- Separate concerns for detection, analysis, and presentation
- Easy model replacement or upgrade
- Extensible chat functionality

### Performance Optimization
